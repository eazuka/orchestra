Orchestra Platform
==============

Provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build. Orchestra is what Bonfire is for CodeIgniter.

## What Makes Orchestra Different?

* **Extensions** are a much needed improvement to bundle implementation in Laravel. With one click activation and upgrade (migration and publish).
* **Database Based Configuration** for any extensions are a solid replacement of file based configuration, stop telling your non-technical client to edit PHP file for any simple configuration changes. 
* **Resources** lets you build HMVC implementation on top of Orchestra Platform. Hook your backend application to Orchestra with just simple API. 
* **ACL and User Management** is a replicative work, let stop doing it and let Orchestra do it's magic. If you need something advanced, there's almost 20 events that you can hook your own implementation without touching any of Orchestra core file.
* **Responsive Design** is always available when you're on mobile.
